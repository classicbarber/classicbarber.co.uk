				<h2 class="text-center" style="font-weight:bolder;">COVID-19 Update</h2>

				<p>At some point in July we hope to return, we're just waiting on the government and our federation to agree a plan so we can work safely. When we return it might well be in stages. There will be a few changes in place to keep both clients and the team safe. PPE will be worn by the team and your temperature taken and hands sanitised on entry. Cleaning, disinfecting and sterilising will be carried out between each client. Unfortunately this will impact on the number of clients we can see each day and therefore prices will need to increase to keep the business viable. Please bear with us a while longer and hopefully, with all our planning, when we do reopen things should run smoothly and safely.</p>

				<p>Should any of our regular clients wish to <a href="mailto:info@classicbarber.co.uk?subject=Appointment%20Enquiry&body=Hi,%0D%0A%0D%0APlease%20keep%20me%20informed%20on%20opening%20arrangements.%0D%0A%0D%0AName:%20%0D%0ANumber:%20%0D%0AEmail:%20%0D%0ABarber:%20%0D%0A">make contact please do so via this email link</a>. Please leave your contact details and include your name, contact number, an email address and most importantly the name of your barber so it can be passed on to the right team member. Please note, this service is for regular clients only.</p>
