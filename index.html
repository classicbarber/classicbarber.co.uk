				<p>We are now open. There are a few changes in place to keep both clients and the team safe. PPE will be worn by the team, your temperature will be taken and you will be required to use our hand sanitiser station upon arrival.</p>

				<p>	Cleaning disinfecting and sterilising will be carried out between each client. Unfortunately this will impact on the number of clients we can see each day, and therefore <a href="price/">prices</a> have had to increase to keep the business viable. You will be <a href="price/">advised of the price when you book</a>.</p>

				<p>Should any of our regular clients wish to make contact please do so <a href="mailto:info@classicbarber.co.uk?subject=Appointment%20Enquiry&body=Hi,%0D%0A%0D%0APlease%20keep%20me%20informed%20on%20opening%20arrangements.%0D%0A%0D%0AName:%20%0D%0ANumber:%20%0D%0AEmail:%20%0D%0ABarber:%20%0D%0A">by this email link</a> as we are unable to answer the phone at the moment for obvious reasons.

				<p>This service is for regular clients only.</p>

				<p>We are unable to take new clients at this time.</p>
